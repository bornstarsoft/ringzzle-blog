If you're a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a copy of Haus Of Irndrous for free on Steam. Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently in early access and will transition to a paid model on July 19, 2025. This means you have until that date to add it to your library at no cost, making it a must-have for horror enthusiasts.

Originally launched in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed as an episodic experience, with the first chapter available for free while subsequent episodes were planned as paid content. However, Yxtopia Studios has recently announced a shift in their business model, stating that the game will soon carry a price tag of $1.99. This change is aimed at funding the development of future chapters and enhancing server support, ensuring a richer gaming experience for players.

With the release of update 17.0, players can expect improvements in enemy AI, performance optimizations, and visual bug fixes. The developers are actively seeking player feedback to shape future content, so now is the ideal time to dive into the eerie world of Haus Of Irndrous. Will you take the plunge before the price goes up?
