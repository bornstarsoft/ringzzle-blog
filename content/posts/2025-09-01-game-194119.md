The New York Times has just launched Pips, a captivating domino-based logic puzzle that adds a fresh layer of challenge to its daily games collection. Unlike other popular games like Wordle, Pips requires players to master both domino mechanics and specific regional rules, making it a unique blend of spatial reasoning and mathematical constraints.

To get started, players can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level presents its own set of rules and board layouts, ensuring that both newcomers and seasoned puzzle enthusiasts can find a suitable challenge. Understanding the game mechanics, particularly the color-coded regions and their mathematical requirements, is essential for success. As players navigate through the puzzles, theyll need to think strategically about domino placement and rotation to meet the conditions of each colored area.

Whether you're a fan of logic puzzles or just looking for a new way to engage your mind, Pips offers a refreshing experience that encourages critical thinking and problem-solving. Are you ready to test your skills and dive into this exciting new game?
