Ubisoft's CEO, Yves Guillemot, recently revealed that the company is developing multiple titles under the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry franchises, signaling a robust future for these beloved series. In a candid interview, Guillemot acknowledged the concerns from protest groups regarding the company's restructuring and job cuts, while emphasizing the importance of innovation and community engagement in their upcoming projects.

The restructuring, which includes the establishment of Vantage Studios to oversee these franchises, aims to enhance both single-player and multiplayer experiences. With over 30 million players engaged last year, the ambition to grow this community is clear. Guillemot also mentioned that anticipation for new Far Cry titles is high, with two promising projects currently in development.

As Ubisoft navigates through significant organizational changes, the focus remains on delivering high-quality games while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the company. Will these new titles meet the expectations of fans and restore confidence in Ubisoft's direction? Only time will tell.
