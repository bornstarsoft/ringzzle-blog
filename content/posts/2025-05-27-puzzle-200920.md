In a bold move reminiscent of the gaming industry's love for sequels, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the ongoing demand for innovative puzzle games but also positions ChromaGun 2 as a potential successor to the beloved Portal series, despite its gameplay leaning more towards the mechanics of Qube.

The game features a first-person shooter format where players utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles. While the setting echoes the corporate testing environments of Portal, the gameplay mechanics diverge significantly, focusing on color-based puzzles rather than the iconic portal mechanics. This fresh take could attract both fans of the original ChromaGun and newcomers looking for engaging puzzle experiences.

With the original ChromaGun receiving 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its 2016 release, expectations for this sequel are high. The available demo on Steam offers a taste of whatâ€™s to come, and it will be interesting to see how players respond to this new twist on the puzzle genre. As we look forward to its release, one has to wonder: can ChromaGun 2 truly fill the void left by Portal's absence?
