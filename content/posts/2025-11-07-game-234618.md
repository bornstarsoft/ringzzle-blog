In a surprising turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending closure due to unsuccessful efforts in securing a new partner for its ambitious project, Midnight Riders. The studio, established in 2023 with a talented team from Ubisoft Toronto, will cease operations on November 17th, 2025, marking a significant moment in the gaming industry as it reflects the challenges faced by developers in the current market.

Studio head Sean Cooks expressed gratitude for the support received from NetEase while emphasizing the team's dedication and creativity throughout their journey. Despite the closure, the underlying intellectual property of Midnight Riders remains available for acquisition, signaling potential opportunities for other publishers or studios looking to continue its development. This situation highlights the ongoing shifts within the gaming landscape, particularly as NetEase has been scaling back its overseas studios.

As we witness the closing of another chapter in the gaming world, one can't help but wonder: what does the future hold for studios facing similar challenges?
