Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, initially developed in 1991 by Chris Oberth and never released, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This revival not only brings a piece of gaming history back to life but also highlights the ongoing challenges of preserving vintage games. Priced at $100, the 2025 release will feature an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that chronicles the games troubled past and Oberths career.

The release of Xcavator serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving our gaming heritage. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundation's archival efforts, this project underscores the need for initiatives that safeguard the stories and experiences of past generations of gamers. As we look to the future, how many more hidden gems await rediscovery in the vast archives of gaming history?
