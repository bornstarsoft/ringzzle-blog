After over 20 years in the gaming industry, Im thrilled to share a personal milestone: my name is officially listed in the credits of a game! AHRO, an experimental indie title by OEH Interactive, has allowed me to contribute to its QA and promotion, culminating in my name appearing twice in the end-game credits. This moment has been a long time coming, and its a dream come true for someone who has always wanted to be part of a games legacy.

AHRO is not just another game; its a unique experience with deep lore and no combat, showcasing the potential of indie games to innovate and inspire. The recent launch of its free v2.0 version on platforms like Steam, Switch, Linux, and Atari VCS marks a significant step for both the developers and the community. Im excited to see how players will engage with this distinctive title and what stories will emerge from their adventures.

As I reflect on this achievement, I cant help but wonder: what other dreams can we turn into reality in this ever-evolving gaming landscape?
