Lost in Cult has just unveiled its next physical game releases, and they are sure to excite avid gamers. The Editions collection will feature Arco for the Nintendo Switch and NORCO for the PlayStation 5, both of which are now available for pre-order. This move highlights the growing trend of physical game releases in an increasingly digital gaming landscape.

The inclusion of titles like Arco and NORCO not only showcases the diversity of gaming experiences available but also emphasizes the importance of preserving physical copies in an age where digital downloads dominate. As collectors and gamers alike seek tangible versions of their favorite titles, Lost in Cult is stepping up to meet this demand. Will this trend continue to grow as more players seek out physical editions for their collections? Only time will tell.
