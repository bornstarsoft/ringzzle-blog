Konami is set to delight fans with the release of a 13-game Goemon collection this summer, bringing classic titles to the Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC. Scheduled for launch on July 2, this compilation not only revives beloved games from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras but also introduces modern features like rewind, quick save, and a music player, ensuring a fresh experience for both new players and nostalgic veterans.

The collection includes iconic titles such as "The Legend of the Mystical Ninja" and "Ganbare Goemon 3," each known for their humor and unique gameplay. While currently limited to Japan, the physical and digital availability of this collection, along with a special limited-edition package, raises hopes for a wider release in the future. As we look forward to this nostalgic journey, one can't help but wonder: will this collection spark a revival of interest in retro gaming among younger audiences?
