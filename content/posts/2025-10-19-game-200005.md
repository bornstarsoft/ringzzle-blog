After two decades of anticipation, the legendary game "Infinity" is set to make its grand debut on the Game Boy Color in Q4 of 2025. Originally developed between 1999 and 2001, this tactical RPG was unfortunately shelved in 2002 due to market challenges. However, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign by Incube8 Games, this long-lost gem is being revived, offering fans a chance to experience its unique strategic battle system and rich narrative.

"Infinity" promises to deliver an immersive experience with over 30 explorable areas, five playable characters, and more than 100 items, all wrapped in stunning 8-bit graphics. The story revolves around an ancient evil threatening to plunge two rival nations into war, with players stepping into the shoes of a disgraced knight tasked with uniting them against a common foe. With pre-orders now available for various editions, including a collector's version packed with exclusive goodies, excitement is building as the release date approaches.

As we look forward to the return of this classic title, one can't help but wonder: will "Infinity" set a new standard for retro gaming revivals? The answer awaits us in just a few short years.
