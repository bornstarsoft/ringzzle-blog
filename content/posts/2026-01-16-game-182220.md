Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be permanently taken offline on January 31, 2027, following a significant shift in the company's development strategy. This news comes as the game has already been removed from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking the end of an era for players who have invested time and resources into this expansive virtual world.

The decision to shut down New World reflects broader changes within Amazon Games, which has seen substantial layoffs and a pivot away from MMO development. Players will still have access to the game until the servers go offline, and in-game purchases will cease starting July 20, 2026. The developers expressed gratitude for the community's support, promising a memorable sendoff for the dedicated players who have shaped the world of Aeternum.

As we approach the final year of New World, it raises questions about the future of MMO gaming and the potential for new titles to fill the void left by this beloved game. How will the gaming community adapt to this change, and what lessons can be learned from New World's journey?
