Highguard, the newly released free-to-play shooter, has made headlines by attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its launch day. However, this impressive figure is somewhat overshadowed by the game's reception, which includes over 13,000 negative reviews on Steam. With only 32.05% of reviews being positive, the community's feedback highlights significant concerns regarding gameplay mechanics, particularly the size of the maps in relation to the 3vs3 matchups.

Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio formed by veterans of popular franchises like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, Highguard's ambitious launch has sparked discussions about player expectations and game design. Despite the rocky start, the game's initial player base indicates a strong interest that could be harnessed for future updates and improvements.

As the gaming community continues to voice its opinions, it will be interesting to see how Wildlight Entertainment addresses these concerns and whether they can turn the tide of public perception. Will Highguard evolve into a beloved title, or will it struggle to maintain its player base amidst criticism? Only time will tell.
