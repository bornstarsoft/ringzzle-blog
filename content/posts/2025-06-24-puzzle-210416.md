In a troubling turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated mass layoff proceedings that could impact over 100 employees. This news comes on the heels of a rocky game launch that has left many players dissatisfied, leading to a significant backlash on social media and a dismal Metacritic score. The studio's decision to start a 45-day consultation process indicates that they are preparing for substantial workforce reductions, a move that reflects the challenges faced by developers in the competitive gaming landscape.

The launch of MindsEye has been marred by technical issues and bugs, prompting PlayStation to issue refunds to players, a rare action reminiscent of the infamous Cyberpunk 2077 launch. With a Metacritic score of just 38 for PC and 28 for PS5, MindsEye has become one of the lowest-rated games of the year, raising questions about quality control and the pressures of game development. As the studio grapples with these challenges, the future of its workforce hangs in the balance, with many employees uncertain about their job security.

As we watch this situation unfold, it raises broader questions about the sustainability of game development practices and the impact of consumer expectations on studios. Will Build a Rocket Boy be able to recover from this setback, or will it become another cautionary tale in the gaming industry?
