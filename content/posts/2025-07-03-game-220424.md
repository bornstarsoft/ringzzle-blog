The recent leak of the pre-release build of Firewalk Studios' *Concord* has ignited a firestorm of discussion about the game's rushed development and its subsequent failure. With a release date of August 2024 and a build dated just months prior, it raises serious questions about the decision-making processes at Sony and the studio's internal culture. The unfinished state of the game, coupled with its swift delisting and player refunds, paints a grim picture of what was once touted as a flagship franchise.

As the gaming community dissects the leaked build, the insights into *Concord*'s development reveal a troubling trend in the industry: the pressure to deliver inclusive and agenda-driven content can sometimes overshadow the fundamental need for quality and player engagement. Sony's admission of needing more user testing and internal evaluation highlights the critical lessons that must be learned from this debacle.

In an era where the gaming landscape is increasingly competitive, *Concord* serves as a cautionary tale. Will developers and publishers heed these lessons, or will the cycle of hype and disappointment continue? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the gaming community deserves better.
