Japan's console game market has experienced an astonishing growth of 138.8% in 2025, reaching a staggering 418.13 billion yen (approximately $2.64 billion USD). This remarkable surge is primarily attributed to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which alone sold 3.784 million units by the end of the year. The data from Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu highlights not only the booming hardware sales, which increased by 149.3%, but also the impressive growth in physical software sales, up by 121.0% compared to 2024.

The success of titles like Mario Kart World and Pokmon Legends: Z-A, which sold 2.668 million and 2.534 million units respectively, further underscores the impact of the Nintendo Switch 2 on the market. With anticipated releases such as Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Resident Evil Requiem on the horizon for 2026, the future looks bright for Nintendo and the console gaming landscape in Japan. Will this momentum continue, or will new competitors emerge to challenge Nintendo's dominance?
