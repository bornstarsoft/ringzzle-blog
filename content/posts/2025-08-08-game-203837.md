Sony has recently acknowledged that its transition from single-player games to live-service titles has not gone as smoothly as anticipated. During a Q1 2025 Earnings Call, CFO Lin Tao admitted that while there have been some successes, such as Helldivers 2 and Gran Turismo 7, the overall strategy has faced significant hurdles, including the postponement of key titles like Concord and Marathon.

The company initially aimed to launch 12 live-service games by the end of fiscal year 2025, but this number has been drastically reduced to just six, with several projects already canceled. Former PlayStation President Shuhei Yoshida expressed concerns about the risks associated with this shift, suggesting that the competitive landscape makes success in the live-service genre challenging. As Sony navigates these turbulent waters, the question remains: can they adapt and find success in this evolving gaming landscape?
