Red Dead Redemption fans have reason to be excited as Rob Wiethoff, the voice of John Marston, hints at some thrilling news related to the franchise. During a recent livestream, Wiethoff teased that he has "exciting news" coming soon, which many speculate could be linked to a current-generation version of Red Dead Redemption 2. With the Nintendo Switch 2 on the horizon, this could mean a fresh opportunity for gamers to experience the beloved title on a new platform.

The buzz around the Switch 2 has intensified, especially after Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick expressed strong support for the console's launch. He mentioned that the company plans to provide more titles at launch than ever before for a Nintendo platform, including major franchises like Civilization and Borderlands. This sets the stage for a potential Red Dead Redemption 2 announcement, which could captivate both new players and long-time fans alike.

As we await Wiethoff's big reveal, the excitement in the gaming community is palpable. Will we see a remastered version of RDR2 on the Switch 2? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the legacy of Red Dead Redemption continues to thrive, and fans are eager for what's next.
