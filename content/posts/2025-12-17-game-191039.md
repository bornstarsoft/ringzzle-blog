In November 2025, anime-style RPGs have taken the livestreaming scene by storm, showcasing their immense popularity and viewer engagement. According to the Niko Partners China Games & Livestreaming Tracker, RPG titles have not only captured the attention of gamers but have also driven significant viewership spikes, particularly during major updates and anniversary events. 

Kuro Games Wuthering Waves and miHoYos Zenless Zone Zero are prime examples of this trend, both experiencing remarkable increases in viewership thanks to their strategic livestream events. Wuthering Waves saw a staggering 36.5 million viewers, while Zenless Zone Zero attracted 30.9 million, highlighting the effectiveness of livestreaming as a marketing tool in the gaming industry. 

As platforms like Bilibili become essential for game reveals, the synergy between livestreaming and RPG updates is likely to grow. With the anime and gaming cultures intertwining more than ever, one has to wonder: what will be the next big title to capture the hearts of viewers in this dynamic landscape?
