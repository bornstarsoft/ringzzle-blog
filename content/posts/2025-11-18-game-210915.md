After two decades of anticipation, the cult classic supernatural strategy puzzle game "Ghost Master" is set to make a grand return in 2026 with its remake, "Ghost Master: Resurrection." Developed by Mechano Story Studio and powered by Unreal Engine 5, this revival promises to deliver stunning visuals and refined gameplay mechanics that will captivate both longtime fans and newcomers alike.
