In a bold move towards recovery, Com2uS Holdings has announced plans to launch eight new titles in 2026, aiming to rebound from an operating loss of 8.7 billion won in 2025. Despite a significant drop in annual revenue, the company managed to narrow its losses dramatically through efficient management practices, showcasing a commitment to improving profitability and expanding its platform business.

The fourth quarter of 2025 marked a turning point for Com2uS, with a notable increase in revenue driven by its flagship title "Soul Strike" and strategic collaborations. The upcoming releases, including the puzzle game "Pawpop Match" and the MMORPG sequel to "TALION," are poised to capture global market interest and further solidify the company's position in the competitive gaming landscape.

As Com2uS Holdings embarks on this ambitious journey, the gaming community eagerly anticipates how these new titles will reshape its financial trajectory. Will these strategic releases be enough to sustain the momentum and drive long-term growth?
