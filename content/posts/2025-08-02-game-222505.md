In the world of game development, the success of Sandfall Interactive's debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, highlights a compelling trend: smaller teams can achieve remarkable results. Tom Guillermin, the studio's lead programmer, emphasized that their current team size is optimal for creating a full-priced turn-based RPG, proving that quality often trumps quantity.

The studio's approach to building a skilled team, focusing on fresh talent rather than seasoned veterans, has paid off. With only around 30-40 core members, they managed to sell 3.3 million copies shortly after launch, a feat that draws attention to the efficiency and creativity that can flourish in a compact team environment. As the industry debates the ideal team size, Sandfall's success raises an intriguing question: could the future of game development favor smaller, more agile teams?
