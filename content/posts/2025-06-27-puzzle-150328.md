Capcom has unveiled a fresh take on gameplay with its upcoming title, Pragmata, introducing a captivating blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. This innovative approach allows players to engage in hacking robots through a mini-game while simultaneously dodging their attacks, creating a dynamic and immersive experience that promises to keep players on their toes.

The game's unique premise and polished gameplay, as demonstrated in a recent media preview, have left many eager for more. With Capcom's impressive track record in the gaming industry, expectations are high for how these mechanics will evolve throughout the gameâ€™s extensive narrative.

As we look forward to its release in 2026, one can't help but wonder: will Pragmata redefine the puzzle-shooter genre and set a new standard for future games?
