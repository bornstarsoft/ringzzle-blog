In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement not only highlights the developers' confidence but also taps into the nostalgia surrounding one of the most beloved puzzle games of all time. With *Portal 2* setting the bar high, can *ChromaGun 2* deliver a fresh yet familiar experience?

While the game draws comparisons to *Portal* through its setting and humor, the gameplay mechanics lean more towards titles like *Qube* and *Qube 2*. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, all while navigating a testing environment reminiscent of Aperture Science. The absence of portals might be a departure from the classic formula, but it opens the door for innovative puzzle-solving experiences that could redefine the genre.

With a free demo available on Steam, gamers can get a taste of what *ChromaGun 2* has to offer. Given that the original *ChromaGun* received 'Mostly Positive' reviews upon its release in 2016, there's a palpable excitement surrounding this sequel. As we look forward to its launch, one can't help but wonder: could this indie gem fill the void left by Valve's silence on a *Portal 3*?
