The excitement is palpable among NTT IndyCar Series fans with the announcement of a new console game developed by iRacing Studios. This game marks a significant milestone as it will be the first IndyCar game since 2004, allowing fans to experience the thrill of racing on iconic tracks like Michigan International Speedway. With a release date set for next year, anticipation is building for what this game will offer.

One of the most intriguing aspects of this new game is the involvement of Scott McLaughlin, a prominent driver who gained recognition during the iRacing events amid the COVID shutdown. His participation not only adds authenticity but also connects the game to real-world racing dynamics. As iRacing expands its console game footprint, fans are eager to see how the mechanics and features will translate from their successful simulator to a broader audience.

As we look forward to the games release, the community is buzzing with ideas about potential modes and options that could enhance the gaming experience. What features do you think would make this IndyCar game a must-play for racing enthusiasts?
