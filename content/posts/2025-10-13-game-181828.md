In recent years, PC and console gaming have transformed from a niche hobby into a dominant cultural phenomenon, generating over 130 trillion won in annual sales worldwide. This resurgence is fueled by the demand for high-end graphics and immersive experiences that mobile games simply cannot match. Notably, Korean game developers are stepping up to the plate, releasing titles that compete on a global scale, such as the critically acclaimed "Stella Blade" and "P's False."

According to recent research, the combined PC and console gaming market reached an impressive $95.1 billion last year, outpacing mobile gaming for the first time. Platforms like Steam are leading the charge, with over 409 million downloads this year alone. The gaming landscape is evolving, with indie games thriving on Steam while AAA titles dominate consoles, highlighting a diverse ecosystem that caters to all types of gamers.

As we look to the future, the excitement surrounding upcoming releases from major developers suggests that the golden age of PC and console gaming is just beginning. Will this trend continue, and how will it shape the gaming industry in the years to come?
