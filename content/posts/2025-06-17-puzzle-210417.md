The excitement is building as Six One Indie gears up for its September 2025 Showcase, set to take place on September 18. Following the success of their May event, which featured an impressive lineup of 48 indie games, this upcoming showcase promises to deliver even more indie game goodness, with around 45 titles expected to be showcased, including several yet-to-be-released gems.

For those who missed the May showcase, now is the perfect time to catch up on all the thrilling announcements and game reveals. The September event will also include a pre-show featuring games that are launching before the main event, ensuring that attendees get a comprehensive look at the indie landscape. Additionally, a Steam event will spotlight around 200 games, making it a must-watch for any indie game enthusiast.

If you're a developer eager to showcase your game, mark your calendars! Submissions for the showcase open on June 20 and will run through July 8. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your game in front of a passionate audience and gain valuable exposure in the indie gaming community. 

As we look forward to the showcase, which titles are you most excited to see? The indie game scene continues to thrive, and events like this are crucial for highlighting the creativity and innovation that indie developers bring to the table.
