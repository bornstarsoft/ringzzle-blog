Nintendo Switch Online has just made a significant addition to its SNES library, introducing three classic games, including the long-awaited release of "Mario & Wario" outside of Japan. This marks a pivotal moment for fans of retro gaming, as it brings a unique puzzle platformer developed by Game Freak, known for its pre-Pokmon era innovations, to a global audience for the very first time.

The addition of "Mario & Wario," alongside titles like "Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind" and "Fatal Fury Special," elevates the total number of SNES games available on the platform to 77. "Mario & Wario" challenges players to guide Mario through a series of obstacles while he is blindfolded by Wario's antics, showcasing a creative gameplay mechanic that was previously limited to Japan due to its reliance on the Super Famicom Mouse.

With the inclusion of these titles, Nintendo continues to celebrate its rich gaming history and cater to both nostalgic players and new fans alike. As we look ahead, what other hidden gems from the past might make their way to modern consoles?
