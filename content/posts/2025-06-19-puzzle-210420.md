The upcoming release of the mobile puzzle game *Classroom of the Elite ~Merge Puzzle Special Exam~* marks an exciting development in the intersection of anime and gaming. Set to join the Crunchyroll Game Vault, this title promises a blend of engaging gameplay and rich narrative, appealing to both anime fans and puzzle enthusiasts alike. With pre-registration now available on both the App Store and Google Play, players are eagerly anticipating the chance to dive into this unique gaming experience.

Originally launched in Japan in February 2024, the game features a variety of missions, character leveling, and unlockable “school miniscapes” that enhance the storytelling aspect. Notably, it boasts full voice-acting and new story content, all while claiming to be free of microtransactions—a rarity in mobile gaming today. The ability to build or break relationships within the game adds an intriguing layer of strategy, making it not just a puzzle game but a narrative-driven experience.

As the anime's fourth season approaches, the timing of this game release could not be better. Fans are hungry for more content, and this game offers a fresh way to engage with the *Classroom of the Elite* universe. Will this game set a new standard for anime adaptations in mobile gaming? Only time will tell, but the potential is certainly there.
