Netflix is making waves in the gaming community by announcing the delisting of more than 20 mobile games next month, including fan favorites like *Hades*, *Braid: Anniversary Edition*, and the *Monument Valley* trilogy. This significant move, which will see the majority of these titles removed on July 14, raises questions about the future of mobile gaming on the platform and what it means for subscribers.

The company, which began rolling out mobile games in 2021, has offered a unique selection of titles exclusively through its app. This means that many of the games set to be removed won't be available on the iOS App Store or Google Play in any other form. While Netflix has not confirmed how many of these games will return to mobile platforms outside its ecosystem, Devolver has expressed interest in bringing its titles back to the mainstream app stores as soon as possible.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Netflix's strategy unfolds and whether it will impact subscriber engagement. Are you a fan of any of the games being delisted? How do you feel about Netflix's approach to mobile gaming?
