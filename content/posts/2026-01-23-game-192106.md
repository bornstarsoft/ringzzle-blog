Double Fine Productions has recently announced their latest project, Kiln, an innovative online multiplayer pottery party brawler that invites players to unleash their creativity while engaging in competitive gameplay. In Kiln, players embody small spirits who must craft their own armor from clay on a pottery wheel, allowing for a unique blend of artistry and strategy in battle.

The game promises a plethora of customization options, enabling players to create armor in various shapes and sizes, from plates to jugs, and even transform into dynamic weapons like pies or sticks of dynamite. This level of personalization not only enhances the gameplay experience but also encourages players to experiment with their designs, making each battle a unique spectacle.

As Kiln gears up for its release later this year on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, with availability on Xbox Game Pass, the excitement is palpable. Players can already sign up for the beta testing program, offering them a chance to shape the game before its official launch. Will Kiln redefine multiplayer gaming with its creative twist? Only time will tell.
